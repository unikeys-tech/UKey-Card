# The UKey Card

### What is the UKey Card ?
The UKey Card is a biometric hardware wallet implementing a fully compatible BIP39/32/44 HD crypto wallet. 

The secure biometric authentication allows users to use their fingerprint to safely enjoy the convenience of contactless payments.

The private keys are generated by the algorithms inside the card and are securely stored in a secure element EAL5+. The private keys never leave the card and are used to sign a transaction during a cryptocurrency payment without exposing the keys to internet.

Communication with the UKey Card happens through an APDU interface. It supports both NFC and ISO7816 physical interfaces, meaning that it is compatible with any Android phone equipped with NFC, and all USB Smartcard readers.
